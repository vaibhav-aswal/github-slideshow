Welcome to **your** repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through. We're glad you're here. The various tasks that I will be leading you through will make use of this repository. See a word that's unclear? Some crucial terms have an emoji () next to them. To see its definition, click on it.

Oh! Since I haven't introduced myself, I'll just ask that you start this repository. If you enjoy it, you can fork the branch and commit. I'm the GitHub Learning Lab bot, and I'm here to assist you as you work to understand and master the range of subjects covered in this course. To communicate with you, I'll be using the comments sections of issues and pull requests. I've even added a problem for you to look at.


I'll meet you over there, can't wait to get started!

This course is using the :sparkles: open source project [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). In some cases we’ve made changes to the history so it would behave during class, so head to the original project repo to learn more about the cool people behind this project.
